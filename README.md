# Vehicle Emissions and Fuel Consumption Analysis

This project delves into the analysis of CO2 emissions and fuel consumption across various vehicle types, classes, and fuel types, using seven years of Canadian vehicle data. Our goal is to uncover insights that can guide decisions towards more environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient vehicles.

## Project Overview

The analysis covers several key areas:
- Median engine size in liters.
- Average fuel consumption for different types of fuel: regular gasoline, premium gasoline, ethanol, and diesel.
- Correlation between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
- Comparison of average CO2 emissions between 'SUV - SMALL' and 'MID-SIZE' vehicle classes.
- Average CO2 emissions across all vehicles and specifically for vehicles with an engine size of 2.0 liters or smaller.
- Additional insights related to fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions.

## Data Source

The data used for this analysis is sourced from the Government of Canada's open data on vehicle CO2 emissions. It includes information such as make, model, vehicle class, engine size, fuel type, combined fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions.

## Key Findings

1. The median engine size of the vehicles in the dataset is 3 liters.
2. Average fuel consumption varies significantly by fuel type, with ethanol consuming the most on average, and diesel the least.
3. There is a positive correlation between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, indicating that vehicles that consume more fuel tend to emit more CO2.
4. 'MID-SIZE' vehicles have lower average CO2 emissions compared to 'SUV - SMALL' vehicles.
5. The average CO2 emissions for all vehicles is significantly higher than for those with an engine size of 2.0 liters or smaller.
6. Further insights reveal trends in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions across different vehicle makes and models.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical analysis
- Matplotlib for data visualization

## How to Run

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Install the required packages using:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

Clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the script


## Conclusion

Our analysis provides valuable insights into how different factors affect vehicle CO2 emissions and fuel consumption. By understanding these relationships, we can make informed decisions to choose more environmentally friendly vehicles.
